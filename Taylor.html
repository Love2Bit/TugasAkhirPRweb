                        <td><p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her artistry, 
                            songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry and popular culture. 
                            A subject of widespread public interest, Swift is an advocate of artists' rights and has had 
                            a political impact.Swift began professional songwriting at age 14. She signed with Big Machine 
                            Records in 2005 and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) 
                            and Fearless (2008). Their singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me"
                            were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats and brought Swift mainstream fame. 
                            She experimented with rock and electronic styles on her next albums, Speak Now (2010) and Red 
                            (2012), respectively, with the latter featuring her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, 
                            "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". Swift recalibrated her image from country to pop 
                            with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album containing the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". 
                            Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".</p></td>
